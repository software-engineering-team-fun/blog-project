- Supports Google authentication
- Allows writing with more than just plain text (bold, text sizes, etc.)
- Global Feed of what everyone is saying!

### Tech Stack
- üî• Firebase for hosting, authentication, and database
- üöÑ Node.js/Express back-end code
- üï∏Ô∏è Just good ol' HTML, CSS, and JS

## Local Build
> Assuming you have a firebase project and want to put this on it

**Dependencies**: Node.js + npm 
```shell
$ npm install -g firebase-tools
$ firebase login
$ npm run build
$ firebase emulators:start
```

You'll also need your private admin key to link your Node.js code to Firebase (look for `privatekey.json` in `index.js`)

## TODO
- [ ] Rewrite authentication to be all server-side (I don't know why firebase likes client-side so much)
- [ ] Add comment abilities
- [ ] Add a dashboard for your user
    - [ ] Enable users to change names, add profile pictures, change email
- [ ] Allow posts to be deleted
- [ ] Fix security bugs
- [ ] Refactor and use TypeScript?
